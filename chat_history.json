I recommend checking a reliable weather source like:\n\n*   **Google Weather:** Just search \"weather Karachi\" on Google.\n*   **AccuWeather:** Their website is Accuweather.com\n*   **Local News Websites:** Search for local Karachi news stations online; they usually have weather reports.\n\nThese sources will provide you with the most up-to-date information on temperature, humidity, wind, and any potential weather hazards.\n\nI hope you have a great day!\n"
